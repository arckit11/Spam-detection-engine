# Spam Detection Engine

This project implements a machine learning model to classify messages as "Spam" or "Not Spam." By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, it identifies patterns in text data to distinguish unwanted messages from regular content.

## Project Summary

The Spam Detection Engine is designed to analyze textual data and classify messages into spam and non-spam categories. The model uses various NLP preprocessing steps, converts text to numerical form, and applies a machine learning algorithm to make predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare text data by removing unnecessary elements, tokenizing, and stemming.
- **Feature Transformation**: Convert cleaned text into numeric features suitable for model training.
- **Model Training & Prediction**: Train a machine learning model to accurately detect spam messages.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for robust spam detection.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for preprocessing and NLP.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for model training, evaluation, and metrics.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data handling and numerical calculations.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bonk18/spam-detection-model.git
```

Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd spam-detection-model
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure Python is installed on your system.

## Running the Model

1. Prepare a labeled dataset (e.g., a CSV file containing messages labeled as spam or not).
2. Preprocess the dataset using NLTK tools included in the pipeline.
3. Train the spam detection model on the dataset.
4. Test the model on unseen data to assess its generalization.
5. To make predictions on new messages, run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Precision & Recall**: Assess the model's spam classification performance.
- **F1-Score**: Balance between precision and recall, providing a holistic performance metric.
